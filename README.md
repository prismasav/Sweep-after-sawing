# Sweep-after-sawing

Final project for the Building AI course (Null knowledge of coding. It's just an idea)

## Summary

Being able to know exactly where we invest our time is the starting point for a good work organization. For this reason, the purpose of this application is to free us from the task of labeling our work in the office environment. 

## Background
This project would require the identification of patterns of use of the mouse and keyboard for the task labeling.
To know how we can improve in our work it is often convenient to know what we are doing and find out how it could be done better or how to organize the tasks in a more suitable order.
  
This project aims to solve the tedious routine of cataloging tasks. 
Often when we make reports it is difficult to have a detailed record of the activity because we cannot always remember exactly how much time has been designated to one or another task. To do this, it would be necessary to recognize patterns of use of the mouse and keyboard depending on the program that is being used. In this way we can know if we are investing time in writing emails, researching on the web, or carrying out design work. At the same time, the program can ask us which client will be billed for the time invested.

## How is it used?
This program is contrived for individual use, so that each worker can be aware of the time spent on each task. However, companies can be one of the most interested clients. Using this method of tagging tasks, it would be easier to discover comparative performance deficits in work teams.

## Challenges
It is obvious that we must sweep after sawing but not so much when we try to organize ourselves in an office environment. Even if this task tagging program were effective, it would not be able to find an optimal order of distribution of the tasks. 

## What next?
I think the real challenge for programmers would be a method of weighing the value of tasks based on their order, time of execution or environment in which they are carried out. If this were possible, not only the order but also the productivity in each of the tasks could be improved.
